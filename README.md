#LiftHub

A platform where you can log all of your workouts and keep track of your progress.

Another neat feature is the Rehab Exercises. These are warm-up exercises for
before and after your workout. These exercises are meant to maximize muscle growth
and increase flexibility.

The motivation behind this is for people to have a place where they can organize
their daily workout routines.
